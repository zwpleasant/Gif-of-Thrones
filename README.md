# Gif-of-Thrones
Winter is coming! This project combines the use of Giphy API with a dashboard to display your favorite Game of Thrones characters, and even has functionality to add a new character of your choosing!

## Instructions
Upon loading the site, click a Game of Thrones character to randomly generate ten gifs of that character. To switch things up and see gifs of a different character, click a different button! If you'd like to add your own custom character, type the character name into the "Search" bar and click "Search." After clicking "Search," you will see a new button generate and ten new gifs will appear!
